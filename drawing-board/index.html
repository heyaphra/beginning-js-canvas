      // as well as its previous position, and whether the mouse is pressed or not

      // It gets the size of the canvas relative to the viewport using getBoundingClientRect()
      // Then returns an array of xy coords properly scaled to the canvas

          // Use scaleMouseToCanvas() to store mouse XY coords into variables
          // Update the mouse object
          // currX and currY should now be moved to prevX and prevY
          // currX and currY should now be updated with the newest values you just grabbed
          // Now that the context has moved to prevX and prevY,
          // draw a line to currX and currY
          // Don't forget to call context.stroke() :)
        }

       * - Make buttons that change the color of the brush
       * - Make an erase button
       * - Make a button that lets the user download the image they draw
       * - Feeling ambitious? Use CSS and JavaScript to make the canvas mobile-responsive
       * - Feeling REALLY ambitious? Use WebSockets to create a live collaborative drawing board
